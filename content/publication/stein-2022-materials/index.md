abstract: 'Insight generation from electrochemical experiments
augmented by data science requires broad, systematic, and
well-defined parameter variations which build upon automation,
data management, and flexible instrumentation interfaces.
Combinatorial electrochemical synthesis of interfaces and interphases with liquid electrolytes by automated high-throughput
robots offers the required high reproducibility. However, automation of electrochemistry is not enough as data needs to be
collected in ways that make it machine readable and interpretable. Once established this integration allows scientists and
algorithms to transfer knowledge and insights from interfaces
and interphases to systems like batteries. Herein, we present
an overview of recent innovative methods of combinatorial
electrochemistry and synthesis which have been integrated into
our platform for accelerated electrochemical storage research
(PLACES/R), targeting the entire battery research value chain.'
