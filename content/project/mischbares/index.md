title: Auto-MISCHBARES
summary: Auto-MISCHBARES, building upon our HELAO framework, is designed for high-throughput electrochemical research. It automates the study of different electrolyte and/or electrode materials, different electrochemical protocols in order to characterize the interphase formations at a millimeter scale, enhancing the efficiency of material discovery.

Auto-MISCHBARES, building upon our [HELAO framework](https://github.com/helgestein/helao-pub), is designed for high-throughput electrochemical research. It automates the study of different electrolyte and/or electrode materials, different electrochemical protocols in order to characterize the interphase formations at a millimeter scale, enhancing the efficiency of material discovery. This system's significant feature is its ability to autonomously asynchronously orchestrate sequential or parallel experiments, integrated with advanced Quality Control assessments and [MADAP](https://github.com/fuzhanrahmanian/MADAP) for advanced data analysis using AI algorithms. The web interface of Auto-MISCHBARES offers streamlined user control, and its database design adheres to FAIR principles, promoting robust and transparent research in battery material science.
