Modular and Autonomous Data Analysis Platform (MADAP) is a well-documented python package which can be used for electrochmeical data analysis.

This package consists of 3 main classes for analysis:

Voltammetry
Impedance spectroscopy
Arrhenius
This package allows user to upload any common file format of data and the select the data of choice. The user can use to scientifically plot and get correspondence analysis from each procedure (i.e. by calling “eis_analysis” , Nyquist, bode as well as the correspondence equivalent circuit and its parameters will be drawn). This package can be installed via pip/conda and can be utilized with a GUI, command line or just directly importing the module in a python script.
